# Data Analysis
 
 The purpose of this project is to build a data platform, from data import, data clean, basic explanatory data analysis, to simple reports.
 
 ## Data sources
 
 * **The dataset from Johns Hopkins University** (dataset updated daily around midnight) (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data) provides realtime information and counts cases of COVID-19 coronavirus in China, as well as around the world, including numbers of deaths, recovered patients, and countries affected. The Hopkins team synthesizes data from WHO and four additional sources: CDC, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, China's National Health Commission, 
and ncov.dxy.cn, an independent data source maintained by Chinese physicians.
  * 1.1  Daily Data : https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports.
  * 1.2 Time Series : https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series

* **COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)** (dataset updated weekly)  (https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) is sponsored by the White House and a coalition of leading research groups. As Mar 23, 2020, this dataset contains 44,000 scholarly articles. Each article is represented by a complex json file. Definitely NLP (natural Language process) is needed to study these data.
